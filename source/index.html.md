# Introduction

## API Introduction

Welcome to the daehk API!

This document is the only official API document of daehk. The features and services provided will be continuously updated here.

You can switch to get the API for different services by clicking the menu above, and you can also switch the language of the document by clicking the language button on the top right.

Examples of request parameters and response results are shown on the right side of the document.

## Update Subscription

We will notify you in advance about API additions, updates and downgrades. We suggest you pay attention to and subscribe to our announcements to get relevant information in time.

## Contact us

If you have any questions or inquiries regarding the use of the API, please refer to the `Q&A` for inquiries.

# Quick Start

## Access Preparation

To use the API, please log in to the web terminal and complete the API key application and permission configuration before developing and trading according to the details in this document.

You can create an API key by clicking [here ](https://www.daehk.com/api/).

Each parent user can create 20 groups of Api Key, and each Api Key can set three kinds of permissions: read, trade and withdraw coins.

Permissions are described as follows:

- Read permission: Read permission is used for the query interface of data, such as: order query, transaction query, etc.
- Trading permission: Trading permission is used for placing, withdrawing and transferring orders.
- Withdrawal permission: Withdrawal permission is used to create withdrawal orders and cancel withdrawal order operations.

After successful creation, please make sure to remember the following information:

- `Access Key` API access key

- `Secret Key` The key used for signature authentication encryption (only visible when applying)

<aside class="notice">
Each API Key can be bound to a maximum of 20 IP addresses (host or network addresses), and API Keys that are not bound to IP addresses are valid for 90 days. For security reasons, it is strongly recommended that you bind an IP address.
</aside>
<aside class="warning"> 
 <red><b>Risk Note</b></red>: These two keys are closely related to account security, please do not disclose them to other people <b>at</b> any time; API Key leakage may cause loss of your assets (even if you do not open withdrawal privileges), if you find API Key leakage, please delete the API Key as soon as possible.
</aside> 

## Interface Types

We provide two kinds of interfaces for users, you can choose the suitable way to check the quotes, trade or withdraw coins according to your usage scenarios and preferences.

### REST API

REST, which stands for Representational State Transfer, is a popular HTTP-based communication mechanism, where each URL represents a resource.

For one-time operations such as trading or withdrawing coins from assets, developers are recommended to use the REST API for operations.

### WebSocket API

WebSocket is a new protocol (Protocol) for HTML5. It implements full-duplex communication between client and server. A client-server connection can be established through a simple handshake, and the server can actively push information to the client according to business rules.

It is recommended that developers use the WebSocket API to obtain information such as market quotes and buying and selling depth.

**Interface Authentication**

Both of the above interfaces contain two types of public and private interfaces.

The public interface can be used to obtain basic information and quotation data. The public interface can be called without authentication.

The private interface can be used for trade management and account management. Each private request must be signed and authenticated using your API Key.

## Access URLs
**REST API**

**`https://api.daehk.com`**

**Websocket Feed (quotes, not including MBP incremental quotes)**

**`wss://api.daehk.com/ws`**

**Websocket Feed (ticker, MBP incremental ticker only)**

**`wss://api.daehk.com/feed`**

**Websocket Feed (assets and orders)**

*`*wss://api.daehk.com/ws/v2`*

## Signature Authentication

### Signature Description

To ensure that requests are not altered, private interfaces other than public interfaces (base information, ticker data) must be signed and authenticated with your API Key to verify that parameters or parameter values have not been altered in transit.  
Each API Key requires the appropriate permissions to access the corresponding interface, and each newly created API Key needs to be assigned permissions. Before using an interface, check the permission type for each interface and make sure your API Key has the appropriate permissions.

A legitimate request consists of the following components:

- Method request address: that is, access to the server address <https://api.daehk.com>
- API AccessId (AccessKeyId): The Access Key in the API Key you requested.
- SignatureMethod: The hash-based protocol used by the user to calculate the signature, here HmacSHA256 is used.
- SignatureVersion: The version of the signature protocol, here 2 is used.
- Timestamp: The time you sent the request (UTC time). For example: 2017-05-11T16:22:06. Including this value in the query request helps prevent third parties from intercepting your request.
- Required and Optional Parameters: Each method has a set of required and optional parameters that are used to define the API call. You can see these parameters and their meaning in the description of each method.
  - For GET requests, each method comes with its own parameters that require a signature operation.
  - For POST requests, each method's own parameters are not signed and need to be placed in the body.
- Signature: The value resulting from the signature calculation, which is used to ensure that the signature is valid and has not been tampered with.

### Signing steps

Because when using HMAC for signature computation, the result of the computation can be completely different using different content. Therefore, please normalize the request before performing the signature calculation. The following is an example of a request for order details:

The full request URL for an order detail query

`https://api.daehk.com/v1/order/orders?`

`AccessKeyId=e2xxxxxx-99xxxxxx-84xxxxxx-7xxxx`

`&SignatureMethod=HmacSHA256`

`&SignatureVersion=2`

`&Timestamp=2017-05-11T15:19:30`

`&order-id=1234567890`

**1. request method (GET or POST, GET for WebSocket), followed by the newline character "\n"**

For example: `GET\n`

**2. add the access domain name in lowercase, followed by the newline character "\n"**

For example: `api.daehk.com\n`

**3. add the path to the access method, followed by a line break "\n"**

For example, to check orders:<br/>`/v1/order/orders\n`<br/>

For example WebSocket v2<br/>`/ws/v2`<br/>

**4. URL encoding of the parameters and sorting them in ASCII order**

For example, here is the original order of the request parameters and after URL encoding

`AccessKeyId=e2xxxxxx-99xxxxxx-84xxxxxx-7xxxx`

`order-id=1234567890`

`SignatureMethod=HmacSHA256`

`SignatureVersion=2`

`Timestamp=2017-05-11T15%3A19%3A30`

<aside class="notice"> 
Use UTF-8 encoding and URL encoding, hexadecimal characters must be capitalized, e.g. ":" will be encoded as "%3A" and spaces are encoded as "%20".
</aside>
<aside class="notice"> 
Timestamp needs to be added in YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss format and URL encoded.
</aside>

After sorting

`AccessKeyId=e2xxxxxx-99xxxxxx-84xxxxxx-7xxxx`

`SignatureMethod=HmacSHA256`

`SignatureVersion=2`

`Timestamp=2017-05-11T15%3A19%3A30`

`order-id=1234567890`

**5. In the above order, connect the parameters using the character "&"**

`AccessKeyId=e2xxxxxx-99xxxxxx-84xxxxxx-7xxxx&SignatureMethod=HmacSHA256&SignatureVersion=2&Timestamp=2017-05-11T15% 3A19%3A30&order-id=1234567890`

**6. compose the final string for the signature calculation as follows**

`GET\n`

`api.daehk.com\n`

`/v1/order/orders\n`

`AccessKeyId=e2xxxxxx-99xxxxxx-84xxxxxx-7xxxx&SignatureMethod=HmacSHA256&SignatureVersion=2&Timestamp=2017-05-11T15% 3A19%3A30&order-id=1234567890`


**7. Generate a digital signature with the "request string" created in the previous step and your Secret Key**

1. Use the request string from the previous step and the API private key as two parameters, call the HmacSHA256 hash function to obtain the hash value.
2. Base-64 encode this hash value to get the digital signature for this API call.

`4F65x5A2bLyMWVQj3Aqp+B4w+ivaA7n5Oi2SuYtCJ9o=`

**8. Include the generated digital signature in your request**

For Rest API:

1. Add all required authentication parameters to the path parameters of the interface call
2. URL encode the digital signature and add it to the path parameters, with the parameter name as "Signature".

Ultimately, the API request sent to the server should look like this:

`https://api.daehk.com/v1/order/orders?AccessKeyId=e2xxxxxx-99xxxxxx-84xxxxxx-7xxxx&order-id=1234567890&SignatureMethod=HmacSHA256&SignatureVersion=2&Timestamp=2017-05-11T15%3A19%3A30&Signature=4F65x5A2bLyMWVQj3Aqp%2BB4w%2BivaA7n5Oi2SuYtCJ9o%3D`

For WebSocket interface:

1. Fill in the parameters and signature as per the required JSON format.
2. The parameters in the JSON request do not need to be URL-encoded.

For example:

`
{
    "action": "req", 
    "ch": "auth",
    "params": { 
        "authType":"api",
        "accessKey": "e2xxxxxx-99xxxxxx-84xxxxxx-7xxxx",
        "signatureMethod": "HmacSHA256",
        "signatureVersion": "2.1",
        "timestamp": "2019-09-01T18:16:16",
        "signature": "4F65x5A2bLyMWVQj3Aqp+B4w+ivaA7n5Oi2SuYtCJ9o="
    }
}
`
## Sub-Users

Sub-users can be used to segregate assets and transactions. Assets can be transferred between the main user and the sub-users. Sub-users can only trade within the sub-user's account, and assets cannot be directly transferred between sub-users - only the main user has transfer authority. 

Sub-users have independent login usernames, passwords, and API Keys, all of which are managed by the main user via the web interface. 

Each main user can create up to 200 sub-users. Each sub-user can create up to 5 sets of API Keys, each with the option to set read and trade permissions.

The API Key of a sub-user can also be bound to an IP address. The expiration limit is the same as the API Key of the main user.

Sub-users can access all public interfaces, including basic information and market trends. Sub-users have access to the following private interfaces:

## Business Glossary

### Trading Pairs

Trading pairs consist of a base currency and a quote currency. For example, in the trading pair BTC/USDT, BTC is the base currency, and USDT is the quote currency.

The field corresponding to the base currency is called `base-currency`.

The field corresponding to the quote currency is called `quote-currency`.

### Accounts

Different businesses require different types of accounts. The `account-id` is a unique identifier for each business account.

The `account-id` can be obtained through the `/v1/account/accounts` interface, and the specific account type can be determined based on the `account-type`.

Account types include:

- Spot: Spot trading account

### Order and Trade-related ID Explanation

- `order-id`: A unique identifier for an order.
- `client-order-id`: A customer-defined ID that is passed in during order placement. It corresponds to the `order-id` returned after a successful order placement. This ID is valid for 24 hours. Allowed characters include letters (case-sensitive), numbers, underscores (_), and dashes (-), with a maximum length of 64 characters.
- `match-id`: A sequential number assigned to an order during the matching process.
- `trade-id`: A unique identifier for a trade.

### Order Types

The order type is determined by the combination of the trade direction and the order operation type. For example, "buy-market" consists of the buy direction and the market operation type.

Trade directions:

- Buy: Buy
- Sell: Sell

Order types:

- Limit: A limit order requires specifying the order price and quantity.
- Market: A market order only requires specifying the order amount or quantity, without specifying a price. The order is matched directly with the counterparty until the amount or quantity is lower than the minimum trade amount or quantity.
- Limit-maker: A limit order that can only enter the market depth as a maker. If the order would result in a match, the matching process will directly reject the order.
- IOC: Immediate or cancel. After entering the matching process, if the order cannot be immediately matched, it will be canceled (the remaining part will also be canceled after partial fulfillment).
- Stop-limit: A stop-loss or take-profit order that is set above or below the market price. The order is only officially placed in the matching queue when the trigger price is reached.

### Order Status

- Submitted: Waiting for fulfillment. Orders in this status have entered the matching queue.
- Partial-filled: Partially filled. Orders in this status are in the matching queue, and a portion of the order quantity has been filled by the market, waiting for the remaining part to be filled.
- Filled: Filled. Orders in this status are not in the matching queue anymore, and the entire order quantity has been filled by the market.
- Partial-canceled: Partially filled and canceled. Orders in this status are not in the matching queue anymore. They transition from the `partial-filled` status, where a portion of the order quantity was filled but later canceled.
- Canceled: Canceled. Orders in this status are not in the matching queue anymore. They have not been filled and have been successfully canceled.
- Canceling: Canceling. Orders in this status are in the process of being canceled. The order needs to be removed from the matching queue to be completely canceled, so this status serves as an intermediate state.

## API Overview

| API Category | Category Link                | Description                                          |
| ------------ | ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Basic        | /v1/common/*                 | Basic APIs, including currency, trading pair, timestamp, etc. |
| Market       | /market/*                    | Public market APIs, including trades, depth, market data, etc. |
| Account      | /v1/account/*  /v1/subuser/* | Account APIs, including account information, subusers, etc. |
| Order        | /v1/order/*                  | Order APIs, including order placement, cancellation, order query, trade query, etc. |

This categorization provides a general overview, but some APIs may not follow this convention. Please refer to the corresponding API documentation based on your specific needs.

## New Rate Limit Rules

- Currently, the new rate limit rules are gradually being implemented. APIs that have a separate rate limit value and are marked as "NEW" are subject to the new rate limit rules.

- The new rate limit rules adopt a frequency limit mechanism based on the UID. This means that the total frequency of requests from all API keys under the same UID to a single node cannot exceed the maximum allowed access times within a unit time period.

- Users can check the current rate limit usage and the expiration time of the time window by referring to the "X-HB-RateLimit-Requests-Remain" (remaining rate limit count) and "X-HB-RateLimit-Requests-Expire" (window expiration time) in the HTTP header. Adjust your request frequency dynamically based on this value.

## Rate Limit Rules

Except for APIs that have a separate rate limit value marked as "NEW" -

* Each API Key is limited to 10 requests within 1 second.
* If an API does not require an API Key, each IP is limited to 10 requests within 1 second.

For example:

* Asset and order APIs are rate-limited based on the API Key: 10 requests per second.
* Market APIs are rate-limited based on the IP: 10 requests per second.

## Request Format

All API requests are RESTful and currently support two methods: GET and POST.

* GET requests: All parameters are passed in the path parameters.
* POST requests: All parameters are sent in the request body as JSON format.

## Response Format

All APIs return data in JSON format. There are slight differences in the JSON structure between v1 and v2 APIs.

**v1 API response format**: The top-level structure consists of four fields: `status`, `ch`, `ts`, and `data`. The first three fields represent the request status and attributes, and the actual business data is contained in the `data` field.

Here is an example of the response format:

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "ch": "market.btcusdt.kline.1day",
  "ts": 1499223904680,
  "data": // per API response data in nested JSON object
}
```
  
| Field Name | Data Type | Description                                                  |
| ---------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| code       | int       | API interface response code                                  |
| message    | string    | Error message (if any)                                       |
| data       | object    | Main data returned by the interface                          |


**v2 API response format**: The top-level structure consists of three fields: `code`, `message`, and `data`. The first two fields represent the response code and the error message, respectively. The actual business data is contained in the `data` field.

Here is an example of the response format:

```json
{
  "code": 200,
  "message": "",
  "data": // per API response data in nested JSON object
}
```
  
| Field Name | Data Type | Description                                                  |
| ---------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| code       | int       | API interface response code                                  |
| message    | string    | Error message (if any)                                       |
| data       | object    | Main data returned by the interface                          |








## Data Types

This document describes the conventions for data types in the JSON format:

- `string`: String type, enclosed in double quotation marks (")
- `int`: 32-bit integer, mainly used for status codes, sizes, counts, etc.
- `long`: 64-bit integer, mainly used for IDs and timestamps.
- `float`: Floating-point number, mainly used for amounts and prices. It is recommended to use high-precision floating-point types in your program.
- `object`: Object, containing a sub-object {}
- `array`: Array, containing multiple objects

## Best Practices

### Security

- Strongly recommended: When applying for an API Key, bind it to your IP address to ensure that your API Key can only be used from your own IP. Additionally, an API Key without an IP binding is valid for 90 days, while an IP-bound API Key will never expire.
- Strongly recommended: Do not expose your API Key to anyone, including third-party software or organizations. The API Key represents your account privileges, and its exposure may result in loss of information and funds. If your API Key is compromised, please delete it promptly and create a new one.

### Public

**New Rate Limit Rules**

- The latest rate limit rules are gradually being implemented. The interfaces with the rate limit value specifically marked are subject to the new rate limit rules.
- Users can check the current rate limit usage and the expiration time of the time window using the "X-HB-RateLimit-Requests-Remain" and "X-HB-RateLimit-Requests-Expire" fields in the HTTP header. Adjust your request frequency dynamically based on these values.
- The frequency of requests from different API Keys under the same UID to a single node must not exceed the maximum allowed access limit within a unit time.

### Market Data

**Obtaining Market Data**

- For market data, it is recommended to use WebSocket to receive real-time data updates and cache the data in your program. WebSocket provides higher real-time performance and is not subject to rate limits.
- It is recommended not to subscribe to too many topics and currency pairs on the same WebSocket connection. Excessive data volume from the upstream provider may lead to network congestion and connection interruptions.

**Obtaining Latest Trade Price**

- It is recommended to subscribe to the `market.$symbol.trade.detail` topic via WebSocket. This topic provides tick-by-tick trade information, and the price in this data represents the latest trade price with higher real-time accuracy.

**Obtaining Order Book Depth**

- If you only need the best bid and ask prices (level 1) for the order book, you can subscribe to the `market.$symbol.bbo` topic via WebSocket. This topic will push updates when the best bid or ask price changes.
- If you need multiple levels of data and real-time accuracy is not critical, you can subscribe to the `market.$symbol.depth.$type` topic via WebSocket. This topic provides updates every 1 second.
- If you need multiple levels of data with high real-time accuracy, you can subscribe to the `market.$symbol.mbp.$levels` topic via WebSocket and send a req request. You can build and update the local order book based on the incremental updates received from this topic. The fastest update frequency for this topic is 100ms.
- It is recommended to use the `Rest` API (`/market/depth`) and WebSocket full data push (`market.$symbol.depth.$type`) to obtain the order book depth. When using these methods, you can deduplicate the data based on the `version` field (discard the smaller version). When using WebSocket incremental updates (`market.$symbol.mbp.$levels`), you can deduplicate the data based on the `seqNum` field (discard the smaller seqNum).

**Obtaining Latest Trades**

- When subscribing to the WebSocket trade details (`market.$symbol.trade.detail`) topic, it is recommended to deduplicate the data based on the `tradeId` field.

### Order Management

**Placing Orders (/v1/order/orders/place)**

- It is recommended to validate the order price, quantity, and other parameters against the currency pair data returned by the `/v1/common/symbols` API before placing an order. This helps to avoid sending invalid order requests.
- It is recommended to include the `client-order-id` parameter when placing an order. Ensure that this parameter is unique for each request. The `client-order-id` can be used to verify the order information received via WebSocket in case the API times out or fails to respond. You can also use the `/v1/order/orders/getClientOrder` API to query the order details based on the `client-order-id`.

**Search Historical Orders (/v1/order/orders)**

- It is recommended to use the `start-time` and `end-time` parameters for querying historical orders. The parameter value should be a 13-digit timestamp (accurate to milliseconds). The maximum time window for querying is 48 hours (2 days). It is recommended to query hourly. The smaller the time range, the higher the timestamp accuracy, and the more efficient the query. You can iterate the query based on the timestamp of the last query.

**Order Status Notifications**

- It is recommended to subscribe to the `orders.$symbol.update` topic via WebSocket. This topic provides lower data latency and more accurate message ordering.
- It is not recommended to subscribe to the `orders.$symbol` topic via WebSocket as it has been replaced by `orders.$symbol.update`. Please switch to the new topic as the old one will be discontinued.

### Account Management

**Asset Changes**

- Use WebSocket to subscribe to both the `orders.$symbol.update` and `accounts.update#${mode}` topics. The `orders.$symbol.update` topic is used to receive order status changes (creation, execution, cancellation) and related trade price and quantity information. Since this topic pushes data without clearing, it has faster timeliness. You can receive asset changes related to your account using the `accounts.update#${mode}` topic to maintain an updated view of your account funds.
- It is not recommended to subscribe to the `accounts` topic via WebSocket as it has been replaced by `accounts.update#${mode}`. Please switch to the new topic as the old one will be discontinued.

# common problem

## API information notification

Announcements will be issued in advance to notify you of new API additions, updates, and offline information. It is recommended that you pay attention to and subscribe to our announcements to obtain relevant information in a timely manner.

## Access and signature related

### Q1: How many Api Keys can a user apply for?

A: Each parent user can create 5 groups of Api Keys, and each Api Key can be set with three permissions: reading, trading, and withdrawal.
Each parent user can also create 200 sub-users, and each sub-user can create 5 sets of Api Keys, and each Api Key can be set with two permissions for reading and trading.

The following are descriptions of the three permissions:

- Read permission: read permission is used for data query interface, such as: order query, transaction query, etc.
- Transaction authority: transaction authority is used for placing orders, canceling orders, and transferring interfaces.
- Withdrawal permission: Withdrawal permission is used to create withdrawal orders and cancel withdrawal orders.

### Q2: Why do disconnections and timeouts often occur?

A: Please check whether it belongs to the following situations:

1. If the client server is located in mainland China, it is difficult to guarantee the stability of the connection.

### Q3: Why is WebSocket always disconnected?

A: The common reasons are:

1. If Pong is not replied, the WebSocket connection needs to reply Pong after receiving the Ping message sent by the server to ensure the stability of the connection.

2. Due to network reasons, the client sent a Pong message, but the server did not receive it.

3. The connection is disconnected due to network reasons.

4. It is recommended that users implement a WebSocket connection disconnection and reconnection mechanism. After ensuring that the heartbeat (Ping/Pong) message is correctly replied, if the connection is accidentally disconnected, the program can automatically reconnect.

### Q4: Why does the signature verification always fail?

A: Please compare the difference between the string before signing with Secret Key and the following string

Please note the following points when comparing:

1. Signature parameters should be sorted according to ASCII code. For example, the following are the original parameters:

`AccessKeyId=e2xxxxxx-99xxxxxx-84xxxxxx-7xxxx`

`order-id=1234567890`

`SignatureMethod=HmacSHA256`

`SignatureVersion=2`

`Timestamp=2017-05-11T15%3A19%3A30`

After sorting it should be:

`AccessKeyId=e2xxxxxx-99xxxxxx-84xxxxxx-7xxxx`

`SignatureMethod=HmacSHA256`

`SignatureVersion=2`

`Timestamp=2017-05-11T15%3A19%3A30`

`order-id=1234567890`

2. The signature string needs to be URL-encoded. for example:

- A colon `:` will be encoded as `%3A` and a space will be encoded as `%20`
- Timestamp needs to be formatted as `YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss` and URL-encoded as `2017-05-11T15%3A19%3A30`

3. The signature needs to be base64 encoded

4. Get request parameters need to be in the signature string

5. The time is UTC time converted to YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss

6. Check whether there is a deviation between the local time and the standard time (the deviation should be less than 1 minute)

7. When WebSocket sends a signature verification and authentication message, the message body does not need URL encoding

8. The Host in the signature should be the same as the Host in the request interface

If you use a proxy, the proxy may change the request Host, you can try to remove the proxy;

The network connection library you use may include the port in the Host, you can try to include the port in the Host used in the signature

9. Whether there are hidden special characters in Api Key and Secret Key, which will affect the signature



### Q5: Why is the gateway-internal-error error returned by calling the interface?

A: Please check whether it belongs to the following situations:

1. Whether the account-id is correct or not requires the data returned by the GET /v1/account/accounts interface.

2. It may be caused by the network, please try again later.

3. Whether the format of the sent data is correct (standard JSON format is required).

4. The POST request header needs to be declared as `Content-Type: application/json`.

### Q6: What is the reason why the call interface returns a login-required error?

A: Please check whether it belongs to the following situations:

1. The AccessKey parameter should be brought into the URL.
2. The Signature parameter should be brought into the URL.
3. Whether the account-id is correct or not is the data returned by `GET /v1/account/accounts` interface.
4. This error may be triggered when the request is made again after the frequency limit occurs.

### Q7: What is the reason for calling the Rest interface and returning HTTP 405 error method-not-allowed?

A: This error indicates that a Rest interface that does not exist has been called. Please check whether the path of the Rest interface is accurate. Due to the settings of Nginx, the request path (Path) is case-sensitive, please strictly follow the case stated in the document.

## market related

### Q1: How often is the current handicap data updated?

A: The current handicap data is updated once a second, whether it is a RESTful query or a Websocket push, it is updated once a second. If you need real-time bid, sell, and price data, you can use WebSocket to subscribe to the topic market.$symbol.bbo, which will push the latest bid, sell, and price data in real time.

### Q2: Will the trading volume of the 24-hour market interface (/market/detail) data interface experience negative growth?

A: The transaction volume and transaction amount in the /market/detail interface are 24-hour rolling data (the size of the translation window is 24 hours), and the cumulative transaction volume and transaction amount in the latter window may be smaller than the previous window.

### Q3: How to get the latest transaction price?

A: It is recommended to use the REST API `GET /market/trade` interface to request the latest transaction, or use WebSocket to subscribe to the market.$symbol.trade.detail topic, and obtain it according to the price in the returned data.

### Q4: When is the K-line calculated?

A: The K-line period is calculated based on Singapore time. For example, the starting period of the daily K-line is from 0:00 Singapore time to 0:00 Singapore time the next day.

## Transaction related

### Q1: What is account-id?

A: account-id corresponds to the ID of different business accounts of the user, which can be obtained through the /v1/account/accounts interface, and specific accounts are distinguished according to account-type.

Account types include:

- spot spot account

### Q2: What is client-order-id?

A: The client-order-id is a parameter of the order request identification, the type is a string, and the length is 64. This id is generated by the user and is valid within 24 hours.

### Q3: How to obtain the order quantity, amount, decimal limit, precision information?

A: You can use the Rest API `GET /v1/common/symbols` to obtain relevant currency pair information. When placing an order, pay attention to the difference between the minimum order quantity and the minimum order amount.

Common return errors are as follows:

- order-value-min-error: The order amount is less than the minimum transaction amount
- order-orderprice-precision-error : limit order price precision error
- order-orderamount-precision-error : Order quantity precision error
- order-limitorder-price-max-error : The limit order price is higher than the limit price threshold
- order-limitorder-price-min-error : The limit order price is lower than the limit price threshold
- order-limitorder-amount-max-error : The limit order amount is higher than the limit price threshold
- order-limitorder-amount-min-error : The limit order quantity is lower than the limit price threshold

### Q4: What is the difference between the WebSocket order update push topic orders.\$symbol and orders.$symbol.update?

A: The differences are as follows:

1. The order.\$symbol theme is an old push theme, and the maintenance and use of the theme will stop after a period of time. It is recommended to use the order.$symbol.update theme.

2. The new topic orders.$symbol.update has strict timing, which ensures that data is pushed strictly in the order of matching transactions, and has faster timeliness and lower delay.

3. In order to reduce the amount of repeated data push and achieve faster speed, the original order quantity and price information are not carried in the push of orders.$symbol.update. If this information is needed, it is recommended to maintain the order information locally when placing an order, or After receiving the push message, use the Rest interface to query.

### Q5: Why is the balance insufficient when placing an order again after receiving the message that the order has been successfully filled?

A: In order to ensure the timely delivery of orders and low latency, the result of order push is pushed directly after matching. At this time, the order may not have completed the liquidation of assets.

It is recommended to use the following methods to ensure that funds can be placed correctly:

1. Combined with the asset push topic `accounts`, receive asset change messages synchronously to ensure that funds have been cleared.

2. When receiving the order push message, use the Rest interface to call the account balance to verify whether the account funds are sufficient.

3. Keep a relatively sufficient fund balance in the account.

### Q6: What is the difference between filled-fees and filled-points in the matching results?

A: There are two types of transaction fees in matchmaking transactions: ordinary fees and deductible fees, and the two types will not exist at the same time.

1. Ordinary handling fee means that the deduction is not enabled at the time of the transaction, and the original currency is used for the deduction of the handling fee. For example: when purchasing BTC under the BTCUSDT currency pair, the filled-fees field is not empty, indicating that the normal handling fee has been deducted, and the unit is BTC.

2. The deduction of handling fee means that when the transaction is completed, the deduction is turned on, and the deduction asset is used as the deduction of the handling fee. For example, when purchasing BTC under the BTCUSDT currency pair, when the deduction assets are sufficient, filled-fees is empty, and filled-points is not empty, indicating that the deduction assets are deducted as a handling fee. The deduction unit needs to refer to the fee-deduct-currency field

### Q7: What is the difference between match-id and trade-id in the matching results?

A: match-id indicates the sequence number of the order in matching, and trade-id indicates the sequence number at the time of transaction. A match-id may have multiple trade-ids (at the time of transaction), or may not have trade-id (creating order, canceling Order)

### Q8: Why does placing an order based on the price of buying one or selling one in the current market trigger an order limit error?

A: Currently, there is price limit protection based on the latest transaction price. For coins with poor liquidity, placing an order based on market data may trigger price limit protection. It is recommended to place an order based on the transaction price + handicap data information pushed by ws

## Account deposit and withdrawal related

### Q1: Why does it return an api-not-support-temp-addr error when creating a withdrawal?

A: Due to security considerations, the API only supports addresses that are already in the withdrawal address list when creating withdrawals. It does not currently support using the API to add addresses to the withdrawal address list. You need to add addresses on the web page or APP before you can use them. Withdraw operations in the API.

### Q2: Why is the Invaild-Address error returned when USDT is withdrawn?

A: The USDT currency is a typical one-coin multi-chain currency. When creating a withdrawal order, you should fill in the address type corresponding to the chain parameter. The following table shows the correspondence between chains and chain parameters:

| chain | chain parameter |
| -------------- | ---------- |
| ERC20 (default) | usdterc20 |
| OMNI | usdt |
| TRX | trc20usdt |

If the chain parameter is empty, the default chain is ERC20, or you can also assign the parameter to `usdterc20`.

If you want to withdraw coins to OMNI or TRX, the chain parameter should be filled with usdt or trc20usdt. Please refer to the `GET /v2/reference/currencies` interface for available values of the chain parameter.


### Q3: How to fill in the fee field when creating a withdrawal?

A: Please refer to the return value of the GET /v2/reference/currencies interface. The withdrawFeeType in the returned information is the type of withdrawal fee. Select the corresponding field according to the type to set the withdrawal fee.

Withdrawal fee types include:

- transactFeeWithdraw : single withdrawal fee (only valid for fixed type, withdrawFeeType=fixed)
- minTransactFeeWithdraw : Minimum single withdrawal fee (only valid for interval type, withdrawFeeType=circulated or ratio)
- maxTransactFeeWithdraw : The maximum single withdrawal fee (only valid for interval type and ratio type with upper limit, withdrawFeeType=circulated or ratio
- transactFeeRateWithdraw : single withdrawal fee rate (only valid for ratio type, withdrawFeeType=ratio)

### Q4: How to check my withdrawal amount?

A: Please refer to the return value of the /v2/account/withdraw/quota interface. The returned information includes the single, current, current, total withdrawal quota and remaining quota information of the currency you inquired about.

Remarks: If you have a large amount of withdrawal needs, and the withdrawal amount exceeds the relevant limit, you can contact the official customer service for communication.

Remarks:<br>
The server returns the "nextId" field only when the data item requested by the user exceeds the single-page limit (set by the "limit" field). After the user receives the "nextId" returned by the server –<br>
1) It must be known that there are still data that cannot be returned on this page;<br>
2) If you need to continue to query the next page of data, you should request the query again and use the "nextId" returned by the server as "fromId", and keep other request parameters unchanged. <br>
3) As the database record ID, "nextId" and "fromId" have no other business meaning except for page turning query. <br>


## Virtual currency withdrawal

This node is used to withdraw the digital currency of the spot account to the blockchain address (which already exists in the currency withdrawal address list) without multiple (SMS, email) verification, and is only available to mother users

API Key Permission: Withdrawal<br>
Frequency limit value (NEW): 20 times/2s

<aside class="notice">If the user has set priority to use the fast withdrawal channel in the personal settings </a>, the withdrawal initiated through the API will also give priority to the fast withdrawal channel. Quick coin withdrawal means that when the target address of the coin withdrawal is the internal user address of the platform, the coin withdrawal will go through the fast channel inside the platform instead of the blockchain. </aside>
<aside class="notice">API withdrawal only supports the addresses in the user withdrawal address list</a>. The IOTA one-time withdrawal address cannot be set as a common address, so IOTA withdrawal through API is not supported. </aside>

## Search history orders

API Key Permission: Read<br>
Frequency limit value (NEW): 50 times/2s

This interface queries historical orders based on search conditions. Orders created through the API cannot be queried after being canceled for more than 2 hours.

Users can choose to query historical orders by "time range" instead of the original query method of "date range".

- If the user fills in start-time AND/OR end-time to query historical orders, the server will query and return according to the "time range" specified by the user, and ignore the start-date/end-date parameters. The query window size of this method is limited to a maximum of 48 hours, and the window translation range is the last 180 days.

- If the user does not fill in the start-time/end-time parameters, but fills in start-date AND/OR end-date to query historical orders, the server will query and return according to the "date range" specified by the user. The query window size of this method is limited to a maximum of 2 days, and the window translation range is the last 180 days.

- If the user neither fills in the start-time/end-time parameter nor the start-date/end-date parameter, the server will default to the current time as the end-time and return the historical orders within the last 48 hours.

It is recommended that users query historical orders by "time range".

# Websocket market data

## Introduction

### Access URL

**Quotation request address**

**`wss://api.daehk.com/ws`**

### data compression

All data returned by the WebSocket market interface is compressed by GZIP, and the client needs to decompress it after receiving the data.

### Heartbeat message

```json
{"ping": 1492420473027}
```

When the user's Websocket client connects to the Websocket server, the server will periodically (currently set to 5 seconds) send a `ping` message to it and include an integer value.

```json
{"pong": 1492420473027}
```

When the user's Websocket client receives this heartbeat message, it should return a `pong` message containing the same integer value.

<aside class="warning">When the Websocket server sends `ping` messages twice but does not receive any `pong` messages back, the server will actively disconnect from the client. </aside>
### Subscribe to topics

> Sub request:

```json
{
   "sub": "market.btcusdt.kline.1min",
   "id": "id1"
}
```

After successfully establishing a connection to the Websocket server, the Websocket client sends a request to subscribe to a specific topic:

{
   "sub": "topic to sub",
   "id": "id generate by client"
}

> Sub response:

```json
{
   "id": "id1",
   "status": "ok",
   "subbed": "market.btcusdt.kline.1min",
   "ts": 1489474081631
}
```

After successfully subscribing, the Websocket client will receive an acknowledgment.

### Data Request

Support data request method to obtain market depth data at one time:

```json

   "req": "market.btcusdt.depth.step0",
   "id": "id10"
}
```

## Market depth MBP market data (incremental push)

Users can subscribe to this channel to receive the incremental data push of the latest in-depth market Market By Price (MBP); at the same time, this channel supports users to request full data in the form of req.

**MBP incremental push and MBP full REQ request address**

**`wss://api.daehk.com/feed`**

Suggested downstream data processing methods:<br>
1) Subscribe to incremental data and start caching;<br>
2) Request the full amount of data (equal number of gears) and align with the prevSeqNum in the buffered incremental data according to the seqNum of the full amount of message;<br>
3) Start continuous incremental data reception and calculation, construct and continuously update the MBP order book;<br>
4) The prevSeqNum of each incremental data must be consistent with the seqNum of the previous incremental data, otherwise it means that there is incremental data loss, and the full amount of data must be reacquired and aligned;<br>
5) If the incremental data received includes a new price gear, the price gear must be inserted into the appropriate position in the MBP order book;<br>
6) If the incremental data received includes an existing price gear, but the size is different, the size of the price gear in the MBP order book must be replaced;<br>
7) If the size of a certain price gear in the incremental data is 0, the price gear must be deleted from the MBP order book;<br>
8) If an update of two or more price levels is received in a single piece of incremental data, these price levels must be updated in the MBP order book at the same time. <br>

Currently only supports the push of 5-file/20-file MBP step-by-step increments and 150-file MBP snapshot increments, the difference between the two is -<br>
1) The depth is different;<br>
2) 5 files/20 files are incremental MBP quotations one by one, and 150 files are 100 millisecond timed snapshot incremental MBP quotations;<br>
3) When only one-sided market changes occur in the 5-level/20-level order book, the incremental push only includes unilateral market updates. For example, the push message contains the array of asks, but not the array of bids;<br>

```json
{
    "ch": "market.btcusdt.mbp.5",
    "ts": 1573199608679,
    "tick": {
        "seqNum": 100020146795,
        "prevSeqNum": 100020146794,
        "asks": [
            [645.140000000000000000, 26.755973959140651643]
        ]
    }
}
```

When the 150-level order book only has a unilateral market change, the incremental push includes a bilateral market update, but one side of the market is empty, for example, the push message contains the update of the array asks and also includes an empty array of bids;<br>

```json
{
    "ch":"market.btcusdt.mbp.150",
    "ts":1573199608679,
    "tick":{
        "seqNum":100020146795,
        "prevSeqNum":100020146794,
        "bids":[ ],
        "asks":[
            [645.14,26.75597395914065]
        ]
    }
}

```
In the future, the data behavior of the 150-level incremental push will be consistent with that of the 5-level/20-level increment, that is, when the unilateral market depth changes, the push message will not include the other side's market depth;<br>
4) When the 150 order books have not changed within the 100 millisecond interval, the incremental push contains bids and asks empty arrays;<br>

```json
{
    "ch":"market.zecusdt.mbp.150",
    "ts":1585074391470,
    "tick":{
        "seqNum":100772868478,
        "prevSeqNum":100772868476,
        "bids":[  ],
        "asks":[  ]
    }
}

```
However, the 5-level/20-level MBP is incremented one by one, and no data is pushed when the order book does not change;<br>
In the future, the data behavior of 150 increments will be consistent with that of 5 increments, that is, when the order book has not changed, empty messages will no longer be pushed;<br>
5) Only some trading pairs (btcusdt, ethusdt, xrpusdt, eosusdt, ltcusdt, etcusdt, adausdt, dashusdt, bsvusdt) are supported in the 5-level/20-level incremental market, and 150-level snapshot increments support all trading pairs. <br>

The REQ channel supports the acquisition of full data of 5 files/20 files/150 files. <br>

# Websocket assets and orders

## Introduction

### Access URL

**Websocket assets and orders**

**`wss://api.daehk.com/ws/v2`**

### data compression

Data is not GZIP compressed.

### Heartbeat message

When the user's Websocket client connects to the WebSocket server, the server will periodically (currently set to 20 seconds) send a `Ping` message to it and include an integer value as follows:

```json
{
"action": "ping",
"data": {
"ts": 1575537778295
}
}
```

When the user's Websocket client receives this heartbeat message, it should return a `Pong` message containing the same integer value:

```json
{
     "action": "pong",
     "data": {
           "ts": 1575537778295 // Use the ts value in the Ping message
     }
}
```

### Valid values for `action`
| Valid Values | Value Description |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------ |
| sub | Subscription data |
| req | Data request |
| ping, pong | Heartbeat data |
| push | Push data, the data type sent from the server to the client |

### Frequency Limit

This version adopts a multi-dimensional frequency limiting strategy for users. The specific strategy is as follows:

- Limit single connection **effective** requests (including req, sub, unsub, excluding ping/pong and other invalid requests) to **50 times/second** (here the second limit is a sliding window). When this limit is exceeded, a "too many request" error message is returned.
- Limit the total number of connections established with a single API Key to **10**. When this limit is exceeded, a "too many connection" error message is returned.
- Limit the number of connections established by a single IP to **100 times/second**. When the limit is exceeded, a "too many request" error message will be returned.
### Authentication

The authentication request format is as follows:

```json
{
     "action": "req",
     "ch": "auth",
     "params": {
         "authType": "api",
         "accessKey": "e2xxxxxx-99xxxxxx-84xxxxxx-7xxxx",
         "signatureMethod": "HmacSHA256",
         "signatureVersion": "2.1",
         "timestamp": "2019-09-01T18:16:16",
         "signature": "4F65x5A2bLyMWVQj3Aqp+B4w+ivaA7n5Oi2SuYtCJ9o="
     }
}

```

After successful authentication, the returned data format is as follows:

```json
{
"action": "req",
"code": 200,
"ch": "auth",
"data": {}
}
```

### Signature steps

For the signature steps, you can view them in the [Quick Start - Signature Verification] section.

Note: Data in JSON requests does not need to be URL encoded.

### Subscribe to topics

After successfully establishing a connection with the Websocket server, the Websocket client sends a request like the following to subscribe to a specific topic:

```json
{
"action": "sub",
"ch": "accounts. update"
}
```

If the subscription is successful, the Websocket client will receive the following message:

```json
{
"action": "sub",
"code": 200,
"ch": "accounts. update#0",
"data": {}
}
```

### request data

After successfully establishing the connection to the Websocket server, the Websocket client sends the following request to obtain one-time data:

```json
{
     "action": "req",
     "ch": "topic",
}
```

After the request is successful, the Websocket client will receive the following message:

```json
{
     "action": "req",
     "ch": "topic",
     "code": 200,
     "data": {} // request data body
}
```

### error code

The following are the error codes, error messages, and descriptions of the WebSocket asset and order interfaces.

## Subscribe to order updates

API Key permission: read

The update push of the order is triggered by any of the following events:<br>

- Scheduled or tracked order trigger failure event (eventType=trigger)<br>
- Cancellation event before triggering of planning order or tracking order (eventType=deletion)<br>
- Order Creation (eventType=creation)<br>
- Order transaction (eventType=trade)<br>
- Order cancellation (eventType=cancellation)<br>

In the messages pushed by different event types, the list of fields is slightly different. Developers can design the returned data structure in the following two ways:<br>

- Define a data structure that contains all fields and allows some fields to be empty<br>
- Define different data structures, each containing their own fields, and inheriting from a data structure containing common data fields

Note: <BR>

- The order type of the stop loss order is no longer the original order type "buy-stop-limit" or "sell-stop-limit", but becomes "buy-limit" or "sell-limit". <BR>
- When a taker order is executed with multiple orders of the counterparty at the same time, each resulting transaction (tradePrice, tradeVolume, tradeTime, tradeId, aggressor) will be pushed separately (instead of combined push). <BR>

## Subscribe to update transactions and cancellations after liquidation

API Key permission: read

Pushed only when the user's order is filled or canceled. Among them, the order transaction is pushed one by one. If a taker order is executed with multiple maker orders at the same time, this interface will push the update one by one. However, the order of these transaction messages received by the user may not be completely consistent with the actual order of transactions. In addition, if the execution and cancellation of an order occur almost at the same time, for example, the remaining part of an IOC order is automatically canceled after the execution, the user may receive the order cancellation notification first, and then the transaction notification. <br>

If the user needs to get order updates updated sequentially, it is recommended to subscribe to another channel orders#${symbol}. <br>

## Subscribe account changes

API Key permission: read

Subscribe to order updates under your account.

### Subscribe to topics

`accounts. update#${mode}`

Users can choose any of the following ways to trigger account change push

1. Push only when the account balance changes;

2. Push both when the account balance changes or when the available balance changes, and push them separately.

### Subscription parameters

| Parameter | Data Type | Description |
| ---- | -------- | --------------------------------- |
| mode | integer | push mode, valid values: 0, 1, default value: 0 |

Subscription example
1. Do not fill in the mode:
accounts.update
Push only when account balance changes;
2. Fill in mode=0:
accounts.update#0
Push only when account balance changes;
3. Fill in mode=1:
accounts.update#1
When the account balance changes or the available balance changes, both push and push separately.

Note: No matter which subscription mode the user adopts, after the subscription is successful, the server will first push the current account balance and available balance of each account, and then push subsequent account updates. When the initial value of each account is first pushed, the values of changeType and changeTime in the message are null.
